Hello, my name is Pedro Cruz and i'm a computer engineering student based in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

I don't really like the idea of labeling me as an {insert_niche} developer. I just really enjoy coding and building useful stuff.

I have experience working with:
- Python (Backend using Flask / FastAPI, Data analysis and display using streamlit)
- C# / .NET (Mostly backend and messaging services using RabbitMQ)

In my opinion quoting all the technologies I can use isn't really that relevant, cause programming languages are just tools that exist for an end, so if I face a problem that will be better solved with a language that I haven't worked with, I'll just learn it.

For any inquiries feel free to reach me at [pedrocruzbusiness@gmail.com](mailto:pedrocruzbusiness@gmail.com)
